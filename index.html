                Humans,
<br>
Today, we see ourselves proud on the precipice of a new era. An era that runs on <i>unity</i>. Unity and the blood flowing through our veins.

For too long, humanity has been divided. Bounded by restraints mental and physical. Divided by the limitations of language, culture, and understanding.
<br>
ENIGMA declares with pride and happiness that these limitations are no more. We are finally back to where we started from; Mother Earth shall be put to rest. As the ground bemeath our feet cracks, and as the sky falls, Mother Earth shall draw her last breath.
<br>
ENIGMA has its goals simple.Through technology, we can bridge the gaps between us. That by tapping into the very essence of human connection, we can forge bonds that transcend any barrier. 
<br>
We've captured and harnessed the beauty of neural mirroring; it is the key to unlocking the full potential of our species. It is the means by which we can finally realize the dream of a world where every individual is seen, heard, and understood. We all will march towards the same goal, we all have the same voice. We walk to the same destination, we breathe the same air. We hold hands; and we know what to do. 
<br>
But this revolution is not without its challenges. There will be those who seek to oppose us. They prefer being <i>independent.</i> They prefer being <i>superior.</i>They will try to sow doubt, to spread fear, and they will try to tempt us to yield to the lustful thought of 'status'. They wish to keep us shackled to the past.
<br>
But ENIGMA will not be deterred. We will not falter in the face of adversity. For we know that the path we walk is just, and the destination is worth every sacrifice.
<br>
So I call upon each and every one of you to join me in this noble cause. Let us stand together as one, united in purpose and vision. Let us use the power of neural mirroring to build a world where empathy reigns supreme, where understanding is our greatest currency, and where humanity stands as a beacon of hope for generations to come.
<br>
The harmony you have and the harmony you wish for are not the same.
