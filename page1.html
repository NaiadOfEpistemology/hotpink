                My name does not matter, but if you're here, you probably want to know something.

                I stand apart from the mundane flow of humanity. I see beyond the superficial. The subtle repulsion towards the commonplace echoes a deeper sensitivity to the monotone life that envelops many. In my quest for meaning, I chose the path less trodden, seeking deeper amidst the shallow pursuits of others. Though isolating, I myself am a testament to my strength of spirit. Unlike YOU, I do not betray truths. I embrace this rare gift of perception, for it granted me the insight into realms unseen by those who merely drift through life without contemplation.
